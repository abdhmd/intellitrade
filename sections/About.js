              IntelliTrade provides actionable low risk/high return trade
              signals in an easy to follow format. The research team at
              IntelliTrade uses a process that has been developed from decades
              of professional trading experience.
              <br />
              <br />
              Unlike Wall Street where the goal is to make themselves money off
              the customerâ€™s back, there is no bullshit with IntelliTrade.
              <br />
              <br />
              We have a strict policy of not front running trades or providing
              trade signals to higher paying customers first. All customers are
              treated equal at IntelliTrade.
